const FAQS = [
  {
    q: "What is a home valuation?",
    a: "A home valuation is an estimate of what your property is currently worth in the market. It looks at factors like recent comparable sales, location, size, and condition, and it's commonly used for selling, refinancing, or general financial planning.",
  },
  {
    q: "How is the valuation of my home calculated?",
    a: "A home valuation is calculated by comparing your property to recently sold homes nearby with similar size, condition, and features. Each comparable sale gets adjusted up or down based on how it differs from your home, and those adjustments are combined to estimate current market value.",
  },
  {
    q: "How accurate is the online home valuation?",
    a: "Online home valuations are a solid starting estimate, but they rely on public data and algorithms, so they can miss details specific to your home, like recent upgrades or unique features. For a more precise number, a Comparative Market Analysis or professional appraisal is a better option.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is an online home valuation the same as an appraisal?",
    a: "No. An online home valuation gives you an estimate based on data and comparable sales. An appraisal is a formal, in-person evaluation by a licensed professional, and it's typically required by mortgage lenders for purchases and refinances.",
  },
  {
    q: "How often should I get my home valued?",
    a: "Once a year is a good rule of thumb, even if you have no plans to sell. Market conditions, interest rates, and neighborhood changes can shift your home's value more than most homeowners expect.",
  },
  {
    q: "Does a home valuation cost money?",
    a: "An online or agent-provided home valuation is typically free. A formal appraisal usually comes with a fee paid to a licensed appraiser, and it's often required for a mortgage or refinance.",
  },
  {
    q: "What factors affect my home's valuation the most?",
    a: "Location, recent comparable sales, square footage, condition, and current market demand are the biggest factors. Renovations can help too, but only when they match what buyers in your specific neighborhood actually expect.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can I use a home valuation to negotiate a lower property tax assessment?",
    a: "Yes, in some cases. If your valuation comes in significantly lower than your county's tax assessment, it can support an appeal. Local rules and evidence requirements vary by county, so it's worth checking with your assessor's office first.",
  },
];

const METHODS = [
  {
    tag: "Market analysis",
    title: "Comparative Market Analysis",
    body: "A Comparative Market Analysis (CMA) is the tool a real estate agent uses to estimate your home's value. We find recently sold homes as similar and as close to yours as possible, usually three strong comparables, then analyze the differences between each comp and your home. Each comp's price is adjusted to reflect what it would sell for if it were identical to your home in today's market.",
  },
  {
    tag: "Professional opinion",
    title: "Appraisals",
    body: "An appraisal is an unbiased home valuation based on a licensed professional's opinion, typically required by mortgage companies for purchases and refinances. A licensed appraiser visits the property and inspects both the interior and exterior condition, measures the home, and notes key features, upgrades, and any needed repairs. They compare the property to recent, similar sales in the area and compile a formal report that includes a building sketch, a map of comparable sales, and photos.",
  },
];

const WHY = [
  {
    num: "01",
    title: "Refinancing",
    body: "A home valuation determines how much you can borrow when refinancing. Conventional cash-out refinances typically cap at 80% of your home's value, while VA loans allow more, sometimes up to 100%, with no minimum equity requirement. The more equity you have, the better your refinance terms.",
  },
  {
    num: "02",
    title: "Qualifying for credit",
    body: "A valuation determines your eligibility for a Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC). Most lenders require at least 20% equity in your home to qualify, and your valuation is used directly by the lender to calculate that equity — higher equity can also mean better rates and terms on the credit line.",
  },
  {
    num: "03",
    title: "Planning ahead",
    body: "Home values shift with the market, interest rates, and neighborhood changes. Checking your valuation once a year helps you track real equity growth over time and prepares you to act quickly on a job relocation, inheritance decision, or unexpected need for cash — you don't need to be selling to benefit from knowing your number.",
  },
  {
    num: "04",
    title: "Home improvements",
    body: "A valuation gives you a baseline before you spend, so you can tell whether a renovation is actually worth the cost. It shows your home's current value and helps you avoid over-improving beyond what buyers in your neighborhood will pay for. Compared against ROI data — minor kitchen remodels return 96–113% at resale, while major upscale remodels return only about 40% — a valuation tells you where your home already stands. Without it, you're guessing whether a project will pay off at all.",
