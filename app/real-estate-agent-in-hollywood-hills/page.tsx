const FAQS = [
  {
    q: "What's it like buying a home in the Hollywood Hills?",
    a: "Hollywood Hills homes vary a lot, from mid-century architectural gems to newer builds with sweeping views. Buyers should expect a wider price range and more variation in lot size, access, and privacy than in a typical neighborhood.",
  },
  {
    q: "Are Hollywood Hills homes a good investment?",
    a: "Yes, generally. Homes with strong views, unique architecture, or good access tend to hold their value well and appeal to a steady pool of luxury buyers, even when the broader market slows down.",
  },
  {
    q: "Why do Hollywood Hills homes vary so much in price?",
    a: "Price depends heavily on the view, lot access, privacy, and architectural style. Two homes on the same street can differ significantly in value based on these factors alone, more so than in most neighborhoods.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do I need a specialized agent for hillside properties?",
    a: "It helps. Hillside homes come with unique factors like geological reports, access roads, and view easements that a general agent may not deal with often. Local experience with these details can prevent costly surprises.",
  },
  {
    q: "How long does it take to sell a home in the Hollywood Hills?",
    a: "It varies more than in flatland neighborhoods, since Hollywood Hills homes appeal to a smaller, more specific buyer pool. Well-priced, well-marketed homes with strong views or architecture tend to move faster.",
  },
  {
    q: "What should I know before selling a Hollywood Hills home?",
    a: "Marketing matters more here. Buyers are often paying for the view, the design, and the lifestyle, not just square footage, so professional photography and smart positioning can significantly affect the final price.",
  },
