/**
 * Static routes only. Property detail pages are driven by IDX at request time
 * and have no build-time slug list, so they're deliberately left out — an
 * incomplete sitemap is better than one full of URLs that may 404.
 *
 * /my-search-portal is excluded on purpose: it's a signed-in area.
 *
 * Priorities and frequencies below are the ones the SEO consultant supplied.
 * The entries marked "not in the supplied list" — the neighbourhood landing
 * pages and /property/sold — are kept rather than dropped: the list we were
 * sent covers 11 URLs against the 25 this site actually publishes, and the
 * pages it leaves out include the ones built to rank for "real estate agent in
 * <neighbourhood>", which have the most to lose from being left out of the
 * sitemap. Worth confirming with him whether they were omitted deliberately or
 * simply not known about — the Valley Village page is recent.
 *
 * Blog posts are the exception: only those with an authored body are listed
 * (see isPublished in ./blog/bodies). The "Coming Soon" stubs are noindex, so
 * sitemapping them would contradict the page's own robots tag.
