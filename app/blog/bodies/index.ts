 * the stubs carry `noindex, follow` in app/blog/[slug]/page.tsx, and they are
 * left out of app/sitemap.ts. A stub has no content to rank, so indexing it
 * only puts a thin, near-duplicate page in front of Google; `follow` keeps the
 * crawl path through to the posts that do have content.

 * act of being written, with nothing else to remember to flip.
