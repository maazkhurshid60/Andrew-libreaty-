                Inventory and days on market have both edged up, which means less pressure to waive
                everything on day one than buyers faced at the peak. Well-priced homes in the
                strongest pockets still move quickly — but the gap between a sharply priced listing
                and an optimistic one has widened, and that gap is where negotiating room lives.

              <h3>What the numbers mean if you&apos;re selling</h3>
              <p>
                A sale-to-list ratio just under 100% says the market is rewarding accurate pricing
                rather than aspirational pricing. Homes that launch above their comparable set are
                sitting, then reducing — and a reduction costs more than pricing correctly at launch.
                Preparation and positioning are doing more work than they did two years ago.

                  Buyers who want a residential, walkable neighborhood with real trail access and a
                  short hop to the studios and the Westside — without moving into a hillside-only
                  lifestyle. The pool skews toward families in the flats and design-led buyers in
                  the hills, but the neighborhood carries both comfortably.
                </p>

              <div className="sc-guide-box">

                  Flat, usable outdoor space; permitted square footage that matches what you&apos;re
                  being shown; a school boundary confirmed for the specific address; and on
                  hillside properties, the condition of retaining walls, drainage and access.

                <p className="sc-guide-a">
                  More than almost anywhere comparable in the Valley. Proximity to Ventura cuts both
                  ways — walkability on one side, traffic and noise on the other. Two similar houses
                  a few blocks apart can price differently because of the boundary line, the canyon
                  route, or the street&apos;s canopy.

                  Permit history with the city, sewer and foundation condition on older flats homes,
                  geology and slope on hillside lots, HOA documents on condos, and the actual
                  comparable set — including what sold and then resold, not just what listed.

                  Noise exposure from Ventura and the 101, driveway grade and guest parking on
                  hillside streets, unpermitted additions presented as finished square footage, and

              Flats homes in good condition are still clearing quickly and close to list. Hillside
              and architectural properties are taking longer — not because demand has gone, but
              because their buyer pool is narrower and the comparable set is thinner, which makes
              launch pricing harder to get right the first time.

                  Everything above is the reason I work the way I do. I&apos;m based in Studio City,
                  and it&apos;s the market I know street by street — which pocket a house sits in,
                  which comparable set actually applies to it, and what a buyer in that specific
                  band is comparing it against.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I&apos;m a REALTOR® and Certified Real Estate Negotiation Expert with a
                  background in commercial real estate, which gives me a sharp eye for value on any
                  deal — a home, an income property or a development site. I&apos;ve worked with
                  buyers, sellers and investors here for years. I&apos;m hands-on and
                  straightforward, and I make sure clients understand the reasoning behind every
                  recommendation.
