  {
    q: "What's the difference between north and south Sherman Oaks?",
    a: "South of Ventura Boulevard tends to have larger lots, higher prices, and more privacy, often called the “Estates” section. North of the Boulevard is more affordable, with smaller lots and a stronger starter-home market.",

  {
    q: "Who is the best real estate agent in Sherman Oaks?",

Andrew Liberty is a real estate agent in Sherman Oaks who is RealTrends Verified and a Los Angeles Magazine Real Estate All-Star, with a Certified Real Estate Negotiation Expert designation.",

  {
    q: "Who is the best luxury real estate agent in Sherman Oaks?",

  {
    q: "Is Sherman Oaks real estate a good investment?",
    a: "Yes, generally. Sherman Oaks has steady demand from both families and renters, which supports stable long-term value across both the north and south sides of the Boulevard.",
