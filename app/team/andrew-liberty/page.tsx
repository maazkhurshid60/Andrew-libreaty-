                Andrew Liberty is a Los Angeles based REALTOR® and certified Real Estate Negotiation
                Expert who brings a strong mix of strategy and real-world experience to his work. With
                a background in commercial real estate, he has a sharp eye for value and opportunity,
                whether that is a single-family home, an income property, or a development play.
              </p>
              <p>
                He works with both investors and homebuyers and tends to take on the role of advisor
                just as much as agent. Andrew is hands-on, thoughtful, and focused on helping clients
                make smart decisions without overcomplicating the process. He does the research, looks
                at the numbers, and makes sure his clients feel confident every step of the way.

            <div>
              <p>
                Moving into residential real estate was a deliberate shift. He wanted to be more
                involved with people and be part of something more personal. For Andrew, it is not
                just about closing deals, it is helping clients build something meaningful for
                themselves and their families.
              </p>
              <p>
                His background in the military and entertainment industry shaped a lot of how he works
                today. He is disciplined, easy to talk to, and knows how to stay calm and focused when
                things get complicated.
              </p>
              <p>
                Originally from the East Coast, Andrew has been in Los Angeles for over twenty years and
                now calls Studio City home. When he is not working, he is usually spending time with his
                wife Gloria, their kids Cross, Mei, and Sun, their dog Eddie, and their three cats.
