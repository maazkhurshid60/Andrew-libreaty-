/** Neighborhood matching for IDX listings.
 *
 * The neighborhood pages want to show what has actually closed nearby, but
 * IDX has no "neighborhood" field — only cityName, zipcode and a lat/lon.
 * How well those identify a neighborhood varies, so the matching does too:
 *
 *  - Studio City, Sherman Oaks and Valley Village are cities as far as the
 *    MLS is concerned, so cityName identifies them. Zip is checked as well
 *    because the feed is not consistent: 3377 and 3378 Canton Lane are two
 *    sides of the same street, and the first is filed under "Los Angeles"
 *    while the second is filed under "Studio City". Both are 91604. Matching
 *    on city alone drops one of them.
 *
 *  - Laurel Canyon and the Hollywood Hills are not MLS cities and their zips
 *    do not describe them. 90046 covers the canyon and a large piece of the
 *    Fairfax flats below it — 735 N Stanley Avenue is a 90046 sale sitting at
 *    latitude 34.0848, about two and a half miles south of the canyon proper.
 *    Calling that a Laurel Canyon comp would be wrong, so these two match on
 *    a coordinate box instead.
 *
 * The boxes are deliberately conservative and the two do not overlap: the
 * ridge line at longitude -118.360 splits them, which is the same "just over
 * the ridge" the page copy describes. They are approximations of neighborhood
 * lines that are themselves informally drawn, so treat them as tunable — if
 * a closing shows up on the wrong page, it is these four numbers to adjust.
