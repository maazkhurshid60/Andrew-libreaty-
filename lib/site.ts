/**
 * Site-level constants shared by metadata, sitemap, robots and JSON-LD.
 *
 * SITE_URL has to be absolute — canonical URLs, Open Graph images and the
 * sitemap are all meaningless as relative paths. NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL still
 * overrides this if it is set in the deploy environment.
 *
 * The fallback used to be andrewlibertyteam.com, which does not resolve — no
 * DNS at all. And because NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL is still not set in the deploy,
 * the fallback is what ships: every canonical tag and every sitemap entry on
 * the live site pointed at a dead host, telling Google the real pages were
 * duplicates of URLs that do not exist.
 *
 * It was then corrected to www on the belief that the apex redirects there.
 * That was backwards, and it was never measured — it came from the sitemap we
 * were sent rather than from the site. Checked against production:
 *
 *     https://andrewliberty.com/       -> 200
 *     https://www.andrewliberty.com/   -> 308  https://andrewliberty.com/
 *
 * and the same on /contact, /blog and /property. The APEX is canonical and www
 * redirects to it. So every canonical tag was naming a URL that immediately
 * redirects, and every sitemap entry was a redirect for Google to follow —
 * which is what Search Console reports as "Page with redirect".
 *
 * If the hosting is ever flipped to prefer www, this constant is the one place
 * to change, and it is worth re-running the two curls above rather than
 * trusting this comment.
